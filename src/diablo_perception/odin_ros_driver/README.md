```

### 3.5 Operation Mode:

The operation mode can be configured via the `custom_map_mode` parameter in config/control_command.yaml.

#### Odometry mode

Set `custom_map_mode = 0` to enable odometry mode. In this mode, the map frame and odom frame share the same pose.

If the odom data is found to drift, the script command "./set_param.sh algo_reset 1" can be used to dynamically reset the algorithm.

#### SLAM mode

Set `custom_map_mode = 1` to enable slam mode. This mode provides a complete SLAM system that builds upon the Odometry Mode by adding **loop closure detection** and **map saving** capabilities.

After launching the driver, odin1 will automatically perform mapping and cache map data. When the scene capture is complete, users need to execute `./set_param.sh save_map 1` in the driver's source directory to save all map data collected since the program started. The map will be saved to the location specified by the `mapping_result_dest_dir` and `mapping_result_file_name` parameters in config/control_command.yaml. If these parameters are not specified, default values will be used.

After the initial save, you can execute the command again to save a new map. Each save operation will generate a new map file. (Please allow at least 5 seconds between consecutive save operations)

The map origin corresponds to the odom coordinate system's origin at the program's startup.

##### Relocalization mode

To enable relocalization, set `custom_map_mode = 2` and specify the absolute path to the pre-built map using the `relocalization_map_abs_path` parameter in config/control_command.yaml.

Once launched, odin1 will initiate the relocalization process based on the current viewpoint and the specified map. To ensure a high success rate, it is recommended to starting within 1 meter ±10 degrees of the original position and orientation from the SLAM trajectory.

Note that relocalization performance is highly environment-dependent. In highly distinctive scenes, successful matching may occur even beyond the 1m/10° range, while other environments may require more stringent conditions. We advise testing in your target environment to determine practical tolerances.

If relocalization fails initially, the system will temporarily operate in a fallback SLAM mode (map saving is disabled in this state). During this time, you can freely move odin1. It will continue relocalization attempts in the background. Once successful, the TF between map and odom frames will be published. (Tip: Gently shaking or moving the device after initialization can help improve relocalization accuracy.)

The following topics are published in the odom frame: `/odin1/cloud_slam, /odin1/odom, /odin1/highodom and /odin1/path`. To obtain these in the map frame, apply the TF from odom frame to map frame.

### 4.4 Data format

1. The raw point cloud (cloud_raw) has the following fields:
```
float32 x             // X axis, in meters
float32 y             // Y axis, in meters
float32 z             // Z axis, in meters
uint8  intensity      // Reflectivity, range 0–255
uint16 confidence     // Point confidence, actual value range from 0 to around 1300 in typical scene, higher value means more reliable. Recommanded filtering threshold is 30-35, should be adjusted accordingly.
float32 offset_time   // Time offset relative to the base timestamp unit: s 
```

To work with this custom format in PCL, first define the point type:
```cpp
/*** LS ***/
namespace ls_ros {
    struct EIGEN_ALIGN16 Point {
        float x;
        float y;
        float z;
        uint8_t intensity;
        uint16_t confidence;
        float offset_time;
        EIGEN_MAKE_ALIGNED_OPERATOR_NEW
    };
}  // namespace ls_ros

POINT_CLOUD_REGISTER_POINT_STRUCT(ls_ros::Point,
      (float, x, x)
      (float, y, y)
      (float, z, z)
      (uint8_t, intensity, intensity)
      (uint16_t, confidence, confidence)
      (float offset_time , offset_time)
)
```
Then, you can easily convert a ROS sensor_msgs::PointCloud2 message into a PCL point cloud:
```
pcl::PointCloud<ls_ros::Point> ls_cloud;
pcl::fromROSMsg(*msg, ls_cloud);
```

2. The slam point cloud (cloud_slam) and directly rendered point cloud (cloud_render) has the following fields:
```
float32 x             // X axis, in meters
float32 y             // Y axis, in meters
float32 z             // Z axis, in meters
float32 rgb           // RGB value
```

### 4.5 Other functionalities

|control_command.yaml   | Detailed Description |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| use_host_ros_time     | Time synchronization mode: 0 - use odin internal system time as data timestamp (typical and recommended); 1 - use host ROS time upon receive (not recommended for most users); 2 - align odin1 time to host time via NTP-like synchronization, timestamp is the sensor data reception time on host time axis. |
| strict_usb3.0_check   | Strict USB3.0 check, if off, allow connection even if usb connection is below usb 3.0 |
| recorddata            | Record data in specific format that can be imported into MindCloud(TM) for post-processing. Please be aware that this will consume a lot of storage space. Testing shows 9.5G for 10mins of data. |
| devstatuslog          | Device status logging, currently save device status (soc temperature, cpu usage, ram usage, dtof sensor temp .etc) and data tx & rx rate to devstatus.csv under log folder. A new file will be created every time the driver is started. |
| showcamerapose        | Display Camera Pose and Field of View. |
| custom_map_mode        | Operation Modes: Mode 0 - Odometry mode: The map frame and odom frame share the same pose. Mode 1 - Mapping (with loop closure) mode: This mode supports map saving. Mode 2 - Relocalization mode: Requires specifying the absolute path to the map file. After successful relocalization, it will output the TF relationship between the map and odom frames.|
| custom_init_pos        | Initialization Position (currently unused). |
| relocalization_map_abs_path        | Absolute Path to Map File: Used for relocalization mode. |
| mapping_result_dest_dir and mapping_result_file_name| Path and Name for Saving Maps in Mapping Mode: If not specified, default values will be used. |

### 5.2 Library binding failure during compilation

**Error Message**  
ld: cannot find -llydHostApi or symbol lookup errors

**Resolution** 

1. Clean previous build artifacts

ROS1 
```shell
rm -rf devel/ build/  
```
ROS2
```shell
rm -rf devel/ install/ log/ 
```
2. Re-run script installation

### 5.3 Docker GUI passthrough failure

**Error Message**  
Unable to open X display or No protocol specified

**Resolution** 
```shell
xhost + #This command enables graphical passthrough to Docker containers
```

### 5.4 ROS driver exit with get version failed error

**Error Message**  
```shell
<ERROR><api.cpp:lidar_get_version:672>: get device version fail.
get version failed.
```

**Resolution** 

Device firmware version is too low, please update to latest version.


### 5.5 RVIZ has not responded for a long time

**Error Message**  
Rviz does not respond, and after a while the terminal prints Device disconnected, waiting for reconnection...

**Resolution** 

Please power on Odin module again

### 5.6 Device not responding

**Error Message**  
Missed ok response from device,probably wrong interaction procedure.

**Resolution** 

Please adopt the solution mentioned in 5.1

### 5.7 Device has no external calibration file 

**Error Message**  
ERROR：Missing camera node 'cam_0'

**Resolution** 

Please plug and unplug the USB again

### 5.8 ROS Driver report device disconnected immediately after stream started

**Error Message**  

```shell
Device ready and streams activated
Device detaching...
Wating for device reconnection...
Device disconnected, waiting for reconnection...
```

**Reason**

Mostly common on ros2 environment and connected to complex network environment, such as office wifi & ethernet. ROS2 default to broadcast, and complex network environment will cause ros2 publish to block, leading to device disconnection.

**Resolution** 

If cross-device communication is not required, please restrict ros2 to localhost only with:
```shell
export ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1
```

If cross-device communication is required, please simplify the network environment as much as possible. Mini local network with only required devices is recommended.

### 5.9 ROS Driver died immediately after stream started

**Error Message**  

```shell
Device ready and streams activated
[host_sdk_sample-2] process has died ......
```

**Test**

Disable odin1/image	with sendrgb = 0 in control_command.yaml and try again. If the driver now works, it is likely that the issue is related to multiple version of opencv is installed on the system.

**Resolution** 

Purge the unused version of opencv and maintain a single complete version, then rebuild the driver and try again.

### 5.10 ROS Driver printing "TF_OLD_DATA ignoring data" warning

**Error Message**  

```shell
[rviz2-3] Warning: TF_OLD_DATA ignoring data from the past for frame odin1_base_link at time 20.547632 according to authority Authority undetectable
[rviz2-3] Possible reasons are listed at http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Errors%20explained
[rviz2-3]          at line 294 in ./src/buffer_core.cpp
```

**Reason**

This is a ros & rviz feature to warn user that some tf data is being ignored due to timestamp conflicts. It happens when user keeps ros driver running and power-cycles odin device, which cause odin's internal system time being reset and now data timestamps conflicts with old data recieved by rviz during last run.

**Resolution** 

There's a reset button on bottom of rviz gui. Click on this button will reset rviz's internal state and stop the warning.

### 5.11 ROS Driver printing "unknown cmd code: xx" error

**Error Message**  

```shell
<ERROR><api.cpp:cmd_data_deal:418>: unknow command code 21.
```

**Reason**

This is due to ros driver version mismatch with device firmware version, resulting in ros driver unable to decode new data added in newer firmware.

**Resolution** 

Please make sure you are using most up-to-date ros driver and device firmware.
